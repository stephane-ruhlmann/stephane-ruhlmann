## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Stephane!

I am a full-stack freelance developer, recruiter, mentor and trainer working mainly around the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)/[React](https://reactjs.org/)/[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)/[Node](https://nodejs.org/) ecosystem.

- I'm currently working at [beta.gouv](https://beta.gouv.fr/), the French state start-up incubator, building products and services around the national [Mission Apprentissage](https://beta.gouv.fr/startups/apprentissage.html)
- I train people on GraphQL, a technology I have been using and advocating for since 2016 (I organized the [first european GraphQL Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/GraphQL-Paris/events/231911562/)) and React with [Hackages](https://www.hackages.io/)
- I help [Comet](https://www.comet.co/) interview developers who want to join the community
