## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Stephane!

I am a full-stack freelance developer, recruiter, mentor and trainer working mainly around the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)/[React](https://reactjs.org/)/[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)/[Node](https://nodejs.org/) ecosystem.

- I'm currently working with [Entourage](https://www.entourage.social/) helping them develop their awesome [LinkedOut](https://www.linkedout.fr/) initiative helping people out of the professional networking loop find a job. (Code is public and available [here](https://github.com/ReseauEntourage/entourage-job)) #React #Node #NextJS
- I train people on GraphQL, a technology I have been using and advocating for since 2016 (I organized the [first european GraphQL Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/GraphQL-Paris/events/231911562/))
- I help [Comet](https://www.comet.co/) interview developers who want to join the platform
- I speak french, english and spanish
